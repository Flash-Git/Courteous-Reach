# COURTEOUS-REACH

## UNFINISHED/UNAUDITED - DO NOT USE

### SUMMARY
This project is a cluster of Solidity Contracts that allow users to safely donate to their choice of verified charities with the least amount of overhead possible.

Users can customise their own personal donation profile, use a preset or choose a single charity.

There should be a slider under each every day transaction to give users a choice of how much (if anything) they want to donate.

This would be easy to integrate into Ethereum "Wallets" and DApps (Decentralised Applications).


### PLANNED
ENS integration.

Support for ERC tokens.

The contracts will be carefully audited before being deployed to the Ethereum Mainnet.

Individual charities need to be contacted so they can verify an address as theirs. We will help them understand blockchain technology as well as show them their options of what can be done with the crypto they receive.

A traditional offchain website will be set up to allow users to visualise the donations, see the list of current verified charities and make suggestions.


### FUTURE
Support for more than just the Ethereum ecosystem.

Add incentives for people to donate (2 way interaction with the greater ecosystem?)
